# Recreating a Platform Ticket 

This project is based on recreating an original platform ticket from an 1895 New Metropolitan Opera House Event with modern web development practices: HTML and CSS. The challenge was to recreate the 1895 ticket to the best of our ability with what we know about modern HTML and CSS.
